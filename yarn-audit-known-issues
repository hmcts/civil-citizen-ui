Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the [`--max-http-header-size=size`][] and/or the [`maxHeaderSize`][] options so that no more headers than the `server.maxHeadersCount` limit can be sent.\n2. Set `server.maxHeadersCount` to `0` so that no limit is applied.\n\n### Credits\n\nThe vulnerability was reported by [Ryan LaPointe](https://github.com/rrlapointe) in https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230.\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230\n- https://github.com/websockets/ws/pull/2231\n\n[`--max-http-header-size=size`]: https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--max-http-header-sizesize\n[`maxHeaderSize`]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#httpcreateserveroptions-requestlistener\n[`server.maxHeadersCount`]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#servermaxheaderscount\n","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q"},"1097679":{"findings":[{"version":"0.27.2","paths":["axios","codeceptjs>axios","@codeceptjs/configure>codeceptjs>axios"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":">=0.8.1 <0.28.0","module_name":"axios","severity":"moderate","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-wf5p-g6vw-rhxx","cves":["CVE-2023-45857"],"access":"public","patched_versions":">=0.28.0","cvss":{"score":6.5,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"},"updated":"2024-06-21T21:33:58.000Z","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 0.28.0 or later","cwe":["CWE-352"],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"id":1097679,"references":"- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45857\n- https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/6006\n- https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/6022\n- https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/6028\n- https://github.com/axios/axios/commit/96ee232bd3ee4de2e657333d4d2191cd389e14d0\n- https://github.com/axios/axios/releases/tag/v1.6.0\n- https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-AXIOS-6032459\n- https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/6091\n- https://github.com/axios/axios/commit/2755df562b9c194fba6d8b609a383443f6a6e967\n- https://github.com/axios/axios/releases/tag/v0.28.0\n- https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0006\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wf5p-g6vw-rhxx","created":"2023-11-08T21:30:37.000Z","reported_by":null,"title":"Axios Cross-Site Request Forgery Vulnerability","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"An issue discovered in Axios 0.8.1 through 1.5.1 inadvertently reveals the confidential XSRF-TOKEN stored in cookies by including it in the HTTP header X-XSRF-TOKEN for every request made to any host allowing attackers to view sensitive information.","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wf5p-g6vw-rhxx"},"1097685":{"findings":[{"version":"4.11.8","paths":["@hmcts/os-places-client>request>har-validator>ajv","@hmcts/os-places-client>request-promise-native>request>har-validator>ajv","@hmcts/os-places-client>request-promise-native>request-promise-core>request>har-validator>ajv"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":"<6.12.3","module_name":"ajv","severity":"moderate","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-v88g-cgmw-v5xw","cves":["CVE-2020-15366"],"access":"public","patched_versions":">=6.12.3","cvss":{"score":5.6,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"},"updated":"2024-06-21T21:33:49.000Z","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 6.12.3 or later","cwe":["CWE-915","CWE-1321"],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"id":1097685,"references":"- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15366\n- https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/commit/65b2f7d76b190ac63a0d4e9154c712d7aa37049f\n- https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/releases/tag/v6.12.3\n- https://hackerone.com/bugs?subject=user&report_id=894259\n- https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/tags\n- https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0007\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v88g-cgmw-v5xw","created":"2022-02-10T23:30:59.000Z","reported_by":null,"title":"Prototype Pollution in Ajv","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"An issue was discovered in ajv.validate() in Ajv (aka Another JSON Schema Validator) 6.12.2.
