For example, `serialize(\"userName=<script>alert('XSS3')</script>; Max-Age=2592000; a\", value)` would result in `\"userName=<script>alert('XSS3')</script>; Max-Age=2592000; a=test\"`, setting `userName` cookie to `<script>` and ignoring `value`.\n\nA similar escape can be used for `path` and `domain`, which could be abused to alter other fields of the cookie.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to 0.7.0, which updates the validation for `name`, `path`, and `domain`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAvoid passing untrusted or arbitrary values for these fields, ensure they are set by the application instead of user input.\n\n### References\n\n* https://github.com/jshttp/cookie/pull/167","reported_by":null,"title":"cookie accepts cookie name, path, and domain with out of bounds characters","metadata":null,"cves":["CVE-2024-47764"],"access":"public","severity":"low","module_name":"cookie","vulnerable_versions":"<0.7.0","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-pxg6-pf52-xh8x","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 0.7.0 or later","patched_versions":">=0.7.0","updated":"2024-10-04T20:31:01.000Z","cvss":{"score":0,"vectorString":null},"cwe":["CWE-74"],"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pxg6-pf52-xh8x"}},"muted":[],"metadata":{"vulnerabilities":{"info":0,"low":2,"moderate":0,"high":0,"critical":0},"dependencies":430,"devDependencies":3,"optionalDependencies":0,"totalDependencies":433}}
