Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the [`--max-http-header-size=size`][] and/or the [`maxHeaderSize`][] options so that no more headers than the `server.maxHeadersCount` limit can be sent.\n2. Set `server.maxHeadersCount` to `0` so that no limit is applied.\n\n### Credits\n\nThe vulnerability was reported by [Ryan LaPointe](https://github.com/rrlapointe) in https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230.\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230\n- https://github.com/websockets/ws/pull/2231\n\n[`--max-http-header-size=size`]: https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--max-http-header-sizesize\n[`maxHeaderSize`]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#httpcreateserveroptions-requestlistener\n[`server.maxHeadersCount`]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#servermaxheaderscount\n","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q"},"1097685":{"findings":[{"version":"4.11.8","paths":["@hmcts/os-places-client>request>har-validator>ajv","@hmcts/os-places-client>request-promise-native>request>har-validator>ajv","@hmcts/os-places-client>request-promise-native>request-promise-core>request>har-validator>ajv"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":"<6.12.3","module_name":"ajv","severity":"moderate","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-v88g-cgmw-v5xw","cves":["CVE-2020-15366"],"access":"public","patched_versions":">=6.12.3","cvss":{"score":5.6,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"},"updated":"2024-06-21T21:33:49.000Z","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 6.12.3 or later","cwe":["CWE-915","CWE-1321"],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"id":1097685,"references":"- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15366\n- https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/commit/65b2f7d76b190ac63a0d4e9154c712d7aa37049f\n- https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/releases/tag/v6.12.3\n- https://hackerone.com/bugs?subject=user&report_id=894259\n- https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/tags\n- https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0007\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v88g-cgmw-v5xw","created":"2022-02-10T23:30:59.000Z","reported_by":null,"title":"Prototype Pollution in Ajv","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"An issue was discovered in ajv.validate() in Ajv (aka Another JSON Schema Validator) 6.12.2.
