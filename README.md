## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Running the application requires the following tools to be installed in your environment:

  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14.0.0 or later
  * [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
  * [Docker](https://www.docker.com)

### Running the application

Install dependencies by executing the following command:

 ```bash
$ yarn install
 ```
Bundle:

```bash
$ yarn webpack
```

Run:

```bash
$ yarn start
```

The application's home page will be available at https://localhost:3001

### Running with Docker

Create docker image:

```bash
  docker-compose build
```

Run the application by executing the following command:

```bash
  docker-compose up
```

This will start the frontend container exposing the application's port

In order to test if the application is up, you can visit https://localhost:3001 in your browser.

## Developing

### Code style

We use [ESLint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint)
alongside [sass-lint](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint)

Running the linting with auto fix:
```bash
$ yarn lint --fix
```

### Running the tests

This template app uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io//) as the test engine. You can run unit tests by executing
the following command:

```bash
$ yarn test
```

Here's how to run functional tests (the template contains just one sample test):

```bash
$ yarn test:routes
```

Running accessibility tests:

```bash
$ yarn test:a11y
```

Running functional tests:

Update required secrets on your machine then run below command

```bash
$ yarn test:functional
```

Running Crossbrowser tests:

Install saucelabs on local machine

```bash
$ yarn test:crossbrowser
```

Make sure all the paths in your application are covered by accessibility tests (see [a11y.test.ts](src/test/a11y/a11y.test.ts)).

### Security

#### CSRF prevention

[Cross-Site Request Forgery](https://github.com/pillarjs/understanding-csrf) prevention has already been
set up in this template, at the application level. However, you need to make sure that CSRF token
is present in every HTML form that requires it. For that purpose you can use the `csrfProtection` macro,
included in this template app. Your njk file would look like this:

```
{% from "macros/csrf.njk" import csrfProtection %}
...
<form ...>
  ...
    {{ csrfProtection(csrfToken) }}
  ...
</form>
...
```

#### Helmet

This application uses [Helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/), which adds various security-related HTTP headers
to the responses. Apart from default Helmet functions, following headers are set:

* [Referrer-Policy](https://helmetjs.github.io/docs/referrer-policy/)
* [Content-Security-Policy](https://helmetjs.github.io/docs/csp/)

There is a configuration section related with those headers, where you can specify:
* `referrerPolicy` - value of the `Referrer-Policy` header


Here's an example setup:

```json
    "security": {
      "referrerPolicy": "origin",
    }
```

Make sure you have those values set correctly for your application.

### Healthcheck

The application exposes a health endpoint (https://localhost:3001/health), created with the use of
[Nodejs Healthcheck](https://github.com/hmcts/nodejs-healthcheck) library. This endpoint is defined
in [health.ts](src/main/routes/health.ts) file. Make sure you adjust it correctly in your application.
In particular, remember to replace the sample check with checks specific to your frontend app,
e.g. the ones verifying the state of each service it depends on.
